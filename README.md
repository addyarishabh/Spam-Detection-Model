# Spam Message Detection Model

### Problem Statement:
Beyond the annoyence and the time wasted shifting through unwanted messages, spam can cause significant harm by infecting user's coumputers with malicious software capable of damaging systems and stealing personal information. So for that we have to solve this problem by train out machine to classify which message is spam and which message is not spam.
### Project Goal:
Create a machine learing model by using Flask api to identify the messages come from various sources(emails, text messages etc.) are spams or not.

### DataSet Link:

### Dataset Description:
In the given dataset we have two features/ columns :
1) message :
   The past few messages are recoreded in this columns.
2) label:
   There are two categories in this column -> Spam and Ham.
